# circle-menu-for-omnis
Experimental library for creating a circular menu for Omnis

I've been experimenting with different kinds of interfaces/widgets that can be used in Omnis Studio to spiff things up. I had heard of the concept of a circular menu several years ago and it always intrigued me.

The idea of click on a button and instead of having a dropdown list/menu, instead the menu items out in a circle around the clicked button.

Notes on how to implement are in the library and is just a sample to spur discussion.

Feel free to use this in anyway you wish.
